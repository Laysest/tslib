TSLib: A unified Traffic Signal Control framework using deep reinforcement learning and Benchmarking 

This framework offers training/testing Traffic Signal Controls (TSC) including both traditional and advanced methods.

## How to install:
updating ....

## How to use:
updating ....

See in some examples.

> python3 SUMO_one_intersection_Chattanooga.py

You can custom your own traffic networks (in both SUMO and CityFlow) if you want.
